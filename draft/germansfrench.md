Germans like to think of themself as distinct from French culturally and with language, and yet politically at times Germans resemble French people at their worst.

As one example, on almost every social media platform Ive been on, Germans in particular dont seem to understand jurisdictional limitations. Yet the left these days harps almost exclusively on anti-racism, and also confusing bigotry and racism...possibly deliberately not even understanding what the two terms mean.

The political left will happily excuse transphobia as long as it comes from a non-binary, who is largely a made up disorder designed to specifically marginalize "binary trans" people. Yet are quick to go after people that hate French and German people who have given the angosphere possibly every reason to hate them.

They were the original pretext why the US became a global empire to begin with. And it doesnt surprise me in the least that many Germans are leftists, because a lot of Leftists in the US are starting to suspiciously resemble nazis at times.

If we really want to tackle issues of descrimination, we also need to not confuse bigotry and racism. And not give other white countries carte blanch excuse to control the American narrative on the left, which has always been a different beast from European leftism based on liberalism.

Germans, if they had the chance, would take over the western world. At the very least French and Germans were the original Far Left and Far Right in the west.
