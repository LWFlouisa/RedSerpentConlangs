An exploration of alternative leftism from the perspective of a binary trans woman. My philosophy is influenced by Passivism, Mutualism, and Progressivism. I will also explore topic the mainstream Far Left wont, such as the history of White Slavery in North African of immigrants from Europe. And other things that go against the narrative of intersectionality.
