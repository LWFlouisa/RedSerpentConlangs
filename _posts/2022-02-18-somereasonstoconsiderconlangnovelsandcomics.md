Lately as I’ve moved away from manga, I’ve been slowly developing the opinion that I don’t necessarily need the US comic or Japanese manga industry to produce what I want to. Japan already had the reputation of not really reading Manga or Light novels produced in English, as after 2020 while I don't really agree with the sentiment, the hashtag #CruelJapan has started taking off within a small niche. Here are some proposals for why one should pursue Constructed Language comics, rather than trying to break into manga:

With a constructed language, you get to the control the exact syntax and vocabulary. In a normal social setting this might not seem extremely important, however note that as the US slowly slides away from Democracy, toward some form of authoritarianism, it’s going to become more prudent than ever to not be bound by the limitations of the English language, that is being increasingly bastardized.

You get to fine tune your target audience so that the only ones that read your work are those that have an actual interest in your constructed language, rather than people who simply stumble onto your web comic or wood block printed volumes. I had in mind for some time I wanted something that resembled both Francophone and Japanese culture, without the disadvantages that come from either ethnic group.

If per chance your work becomes popular, then your brand of sequential art will become a mainstream word people will use for any comics that are in that style. Increasingly I’m moving in the direction of becoming “Post Manga”, or the comics generation after the Manga Revolution. Why try and fix the Japanese manga industry, when you can completely write it off and move into your own form of storytelling without needing the manga industries permission.

That’s not to say I’ll never consider trying to get into the manga industry, and I already use platforms like Manga-No. I’m also currently looking for an English language light novel website. For right now Honeyfeed seems to mainly suit these needs, although I’m developing my own light novel format: “Original Azusacos Language Light Novels”, which have a more traditional visual style and aesthetic that combines Impressionism and Sumi Painting. I’m also on Webnovel.
