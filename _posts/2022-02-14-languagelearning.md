## Motivation
Imagine if, and leftists take note, if your coupling someone gatekeeping you about JRPGs, calling you racist for bashing French teachers ( who is the same race as you ), and gaslighting you in other ways.

Most people, rightfully, would have weird associations. In that note, this conlang was created as a work around so as not to have to deal with chronic emotional abusers over language related topics, so I can focus on self study.

But emotional abuse is an underestimated phenominon on the left, and were a better polity if we acknowledge it also exists on the left.

## Mission
This will gradually introduce a new Japanese loan word into standard French each day, and other language minutia.

These will be modified to consonant shifts.
